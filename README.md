# coolcode

A command-line AI coding assistant similar to aider, built with Node.js.

## Features

- 🤖 Interactive chat interface for code modifications
- 📁 Smart context management with auto-file detection
- 🔍 SEARCH/REPLACE block parsing and application
- 🛠️ Git integration and diff visualization
- 🎯 Consolidated prompt management
- 🔧 Modular tool abstractions

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Global Installation

To use coolcode from any directory, you can link it globally:

```bash
# Make the launcher executable and link globally
chmod +x bin/code-assistant
npm link

# Now you can use 'coolcode' from any directory
cd /path/to/your/project
coolcode chat
```

To unlink:

```bash
npm run unlink
# or manually: npm unlink -g
```

This creates a global symlink that allows you to run `coolcode` from any folder while working on different projects.

## Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys:

```bash
# For Claude (default)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# For OpenAI (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Or set environment variables:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

## Usage

### Interactive Chat Mode (Default)

Simply run coolcode to start interactive chat mode:

```bash
coolcode
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm start
```

You can also explicitly use the chat command with options:

```bash
coolcode chat -f src/index.js package.json
```

Disable auto-apply and auto-commit:

```bash
coolcode chat --no-auto-apply --no-auto-commit
```

### Single Command Mode

```bash
coolcode apply "Add error handling to the main function"
```

With dry run:

```bash
coolcode apply "Refactor the user interface" --dry-run
```

Disable automatic behavior:

```bash
coolcode apply "Fix the bug" --no-auto-apply --no-auto-commit
```

### CLI Commands

In interactive mode:

- `help` - Show available commands
- `/add <files...>` - Add files to context
- `/remove <files...>` - Remove files from context
- `/context` - Show current context
- `/config` - Show current configuration
- `/set <key>=<value>` - Set configuration (autoApply, autoCommit, dryRun)
- `/clear` - Clear screen
- `/multi-start` - Enter multi-line input mode for complex requests
- `exit` or `quit` - Exit

#### Multi-line Input

For complex requests that span multiple lines (like detailed specifications, code examples, or long explanations), use the multi-line input mode:

1. Type `/multi-start` to begin multi-line input
2. Enter your request across multiple lines
3. Type `/multi-end` on an empty line to finish and send

This is especially useful when you need to include code snippets, detailed requirements, or structured requests in your message to the AI assistant.

### Default Behavior

By default, the assistant will:
1. **Automatically apply** code changes without asking for confirmation
2. **Automatically commit** changes to git with generated commit messages
3. Show diffs before applying changes

You can override this behavior with command-line flags or runtime configuration.

## Configuration

The assistant supports various models and options:

```bash
# Use Claude (default)
coolcode --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

# Use OpenAI
coolcode --model gpt-4
coolcode apply "Fix the bug" --files src/bug.js --model gpt-3.5-turbo
```

Supported models:
- **Claude**: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `claude-3-haiku-20240307`, `claude-3-opus-20240229`
- **OpenAI**: `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4-turbo`

## How It Works

The Code Assistant follows a structured flow from user input to code changes:

### 1. Input Processing
- **CLI Interface** (`CLIInterface.js`) captures user input and handles special commands (`/add`, `/remove`, etc.)
- For coding requests, the input is passed to the **Code Assistant** orchestrator

### 2. Code Assistant Orchestrator
The **Code Assistant** (`CodeAssistant.js`) serves as the central coordinator that:
- **Manages Configuration**: Tracks settings like `autoApply`, `autoCommit`, `dryRun`, and selected model
- **Coordinates Components**: Initializes and manages all tool instances (ContextManager, PromptLoader, LLMProvider, etc.)
- **Handles Lifecycle**: Ensures proper initialization order and manages the complete request-response cycle
- **Processes Requests**: Takes user input and orchestrates the entire flow from context assembly to change application
- **Error Handling**: Provides centralized error handling and logging throughout the process

### 3. Context Assembly & Prompt Structure
- **Context Manager** (`ContextManager.js`) maintains a map of loaded files and their contents
- **Prompt Loader** (`PromptLoader.js`) assembles the final prompt sent to the LLM with this structure:

```
[System Prompt - from prompts/system.txt]
- Instructions on how to act as an expert software developer
- Rules for SEARCH/REPLACE block format
- Guidelines for suggesting shell commands

[Context Information - from prompts/context.txt]
- Current project state: {totalFiles} files, {totalSize} bytes
- List of files in context:
  - file1.js
  - file2.py
  - ...

[File Contents]
=== path/to/file1.js ===
[actual file content]

=== path/to/file2.py ===
[actual file content]

[User Request]
{user's actual request}
```

This structured approach ensures the LLM has complete context about the codebase, clear instructions on response format, and the specific user request.

### 4. LLM Interaction
- **LLM Provider** (`LLMProvider.js`) sends the assembled prompt to the configured AI model (Claude/OpenAI)
- The provider handles API communication, model selection, and returns the model's response
- Supports both streaming and non-streaming responses depending on the interface

### 5. Response Parsing
The **Code Assistant** orchestrator parses the LLM response by:
- Using regex to extract SEARCH/REPLACE blocks from the response text
- Extracting file paths from lines preceding each code block
- Validating block structure and ensuring proper formatting
- Converting each block into a structured change object: `{ file, search, replace }`
- Handling edge cases like new file creation (empty search section)

### 6. Change Application
- **Diff Tool** (`DiffTool.js`) generates visual diffs showing what will change
- If not in dry-run mode, changes are applied by:
  - Reading existing file content
  - Performing search/replace operations
  - Writing updated content back to files
  - Creating new files when search section is empty

### 7. Git Integration
- **Git Tool** (`GitTool.js`) automatically stages changed files
- Generates descriptive commit messages based on user request and modified files
- Commits changes if auto-commit is enabled

### Internal Flow Diagram
```
User Input → CLI Interface → Code Assistant
                                ↓
Context Manager ← Prompt Loader ← LLM Provider
                                ↓
Response Parsing → Diff Tool → File System
                                ↓
Git Tool → Commit (if enabled)
```

This architecture ensures clean separation of concerns while maintaining a smooth user experience from request to applied changes.
